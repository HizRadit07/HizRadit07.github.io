## About

I’m a Data Scientist based in Jakarta with experience building:

- End-to-end credit scoring systems (1M+ records)
- Transformer-based NLP mapping systems
- Indonesian TTS and voice cloning systems using VALL-E–based architectures

My focus is on practical machine learning systems that operate reliably in real-world environments.

## Tech

This site is intentionally built using:

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

No frameworks or build tools — kept minimal by design.

---

## Deployment

Deployed via GitHub Pages from the `main` branch.  
Any push to `main` updates the live site.
