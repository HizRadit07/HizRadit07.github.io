      <h2>About</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          I'm a Data Scientist based in Jakarta with a background in Machine Learning,
          Natural Language Processing, and Speech Processing. My work focuses on building
          practical AI systems that operate at scale — particularly in financial risk
          environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've developed end-to-end credit scoring systems on datasets exceeding 1M+ records,
          built transformer-based NLP mapping systems, and conducted applied research in
          Indonesian Text-to-Speech and voice cloning using VALL-E–based architectures.
